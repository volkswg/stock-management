# Architecture guide

Current ownership verified against merged main `71dcfe145a4ae835dbd693b2ba6dce00d4e3edcb` (PR23). This guide separates implemented slices from remaining work; it does not claim the repository fully conforms to the target architecture.

Orders contracts/UI/list/simple-create/detail seams and Shipment contracts/UI/core server seams are implemented. Shared Google transports and ten Orders/Shipment/Sales worksheet classes have physical owners. Legacy facades, aggregate Sheets composition, other feature workflows and worksheets remain. PR23 delivered an Inventory employee-directory prerequisite, **not** the HR worksheet move. See the map and roadmap before choosing a slice.

## Documentation maintenance

Update these canonical documents when ownership or behavior evidence changes. Do not create one Markdown file for each small PR. A standalone document requires lasting independent value (for example, an operational procedure), a clear owner and a link from this guide or the project README.

Keep one authoritative roadmap and one progress ledger. Record completed work and verification provenance once in progress; link immutable original PR/commit evidence instead of repeating old status paragraphs throughout architecture pages. Current-state statements describe the current source, not an earlier PR's temporary exception. Never overwrite historical test fixtures or source hashes to match a refactor.

At cleanup milestones, review links, obsolete plans, duplicate evidence and remaining debt. Before removing a document, audit tracked source/tests/fixtures, other docs and published PR references; preserve required evidence and provide an old-to-new index. Do not delete merely to reduce a file count. Keep operational guides at stable paths unless a separate need justifies moving them.
